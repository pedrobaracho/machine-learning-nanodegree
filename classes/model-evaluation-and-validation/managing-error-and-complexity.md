# Managing error and complexity

## Causes of error

Errors are mainly due to 2 common causes:

- Bias: which means a model is unable to represent the whole complexity of the underlying data.
- Variance: whcih means a model is too sensitive due to the limited data it was trained on.

## Error due to Bias

Bias occurs when a model has enough data but is not complex enough to capture the underlying relationships. As a result, the model consistently and systematically misrepresents the data, leading to low accuracy in prediction. This is known as *underfitting*.

To overcome error from bias, we need a more complex model.
