# Deep Neural Networks

Linear models provide various benefits:

![Linear Models are efficient](images/deep-neural-networks/linear-models-are-efficient.png)

So we want to keep using linear models. But we need to introduce some non-linearity into these models to better represent other functions. Multiplying `W` by linear functions, doesn't solve this problem.
