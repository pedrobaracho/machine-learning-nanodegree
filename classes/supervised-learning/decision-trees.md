- **Hypothesis class** is the set of all concepts that we are willing to study to find the target concept.
- **Sample** (aka training set) is a set of all the inputs paired with their expected output that will be used to improve the concept.
- **Candidate** is a concept that might be the target concept
- **Testing Set** is a set of all inputs paired with their expected output that will be used to validate the candidate.
