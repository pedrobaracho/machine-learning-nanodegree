## What set of words in a memo do you think could help predict what a missing word might be? 

Based on my intuition on how humans interpret text, I would say that the set of words that can help predict what a missing word might be are **nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives**, because they are central to understanding the context of the sentence. For academic purposes, I would do research investigating statistically the words that have the better split on the following words. This would be empirically the best words to predict a missing word. Also note, that these conclusions may change regarding the language used during the study.

## What are some advantages and disadvantages of using more or fewer possible influences in prediction? 

The advantages of using **more influences** on prediction is the ability to **generalize better**. For instance, if the model can be built upon a vast vocabulary with lots of data to sample on, it might infer some relationships between words that a simpler model might not be able to infer. The disadvantage is that if the **model doesn't have enough data, it might overfit and be too sensitive to noise**, thus casting wrong predictions.
