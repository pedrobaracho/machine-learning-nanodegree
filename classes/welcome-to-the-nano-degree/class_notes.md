# What is Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a broad concept that involves AI, Statistics and Algorithms.

- Like AI, Machine Learning is about processing and understanding data to react inteligently upon it.
- Like Statistics, it is about applying complex formulas to make sense, compare, evaluate and summarize data.
- Like Algorithms, it operates on data input and provides some output.

In conclusion, Machine Learning is an evolution of all these areas.
